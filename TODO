- Move scheduling stuff into Unit.java -- getting facility maintenance stuff will
  be done by calling each unit, and then aggregating all of the Unit maintenance
  /inspection/etc
  - This means we should move maintenance and everything into unit, as well.
- Therefore we will have the following:

  - FacilityDAO: Table for each facility -- listing owner, address, etc
  - UnitDAO: UnitID and whatever else there is -- not going to list maintenance requests
             and stuff in here, since that would involve placing a list inside of a column.
  - MaintenanceDAO: This one will list all of the maintenance requests -- perhaps have
  a table per unit?

- Maintenance will be done purely through inspections. That is, once we've scheduled inspections,
  we'll run through the inspectionRequest list, and schedule a bunch of maintenance events.

- Switch to Postgresql

- Possiblity -- read a schedule from a text file, to make the whole scheduling stuff easier?

Unit.java ----------
- Inspection Log
- Maintenance Log (both of these kept in table)
-
